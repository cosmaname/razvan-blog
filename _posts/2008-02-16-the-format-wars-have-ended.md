Unfortunately, Sony won. Warner Bros., Wal-Mart and Netflix have chosen Blu-Ray, and - [from an article in an American newspaper (Hollywood Reporter)](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ib77125d96b22e86027d0bfb0c25aa58d):

> "Immediately after the Warner announcement, the HD DVD North American Promotional Group canceled its Consumer Electronics Show presentation. The following week, data collected by the NPD Group revealed Blu-ray took in 93% of all hardware sales for that week"

Snif. HD-DVD, I hardly knew ye. And I really wanted to see "the other guys" win, after a few encounters with such gems as  
- intentionally broken CDs  
- "we don't sell laptops in Eastern Europe"  
- "buy all your movies again for the PSP, and store them on a disk we will no longer manufacture in a few months"  
- the rootkit  
and a few other personal peeves, Sony is definitely not in my top fave companies.
